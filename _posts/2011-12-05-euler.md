STL Coders met again at Felix's, who have been very hospitable to STL Coders,
having helped with powering our massive-awesome 4-year old Macbooks and have
provided great pizza and reasonably priced drinks.  Thanks again to Felix's, and

## Project Euler

We discussed using the [ Euler Project ]( http://projecteuler.net/) project as a
resource for learning Clojure.  We spent a little bit of time talking about how
to solve [ Problem 25] (http://projecteuler.net/problem=25):  Find the first
number in the Fibonacci sequence that contains 1000 digits.

Although we didn't come up with much code, this problem opened an important
discussion about Clojure and how it handles "overflow" with Number classes.  To
be continued!

## New Addition to STL Coders

This week we added a new STLCoder -- Noah.  Noah volunteers @
[Bworks](http://bworks.org) and is an exceptional programmer even at the
physical age of 17 and the mental age of 9 or 30, depending on whether he's
bored or not.

## Meeting Notes

Psyche! At STLCoders, we `(do 'code)`.  No meetings allowed.
