<h2>Ideas</h2>
<p>Anyone in STL Coders should grow a pair and put their ideas here.</p>  


<h3>CSS Step By Step</h3>
<p>
Take some fairly cool pages like Twitter's <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> 
and strip the CSS down to bare metal.  Then, apply only the CSS styles one at a
time, and see how the page evolves.  If a CSS style doesn't appear to do
anything, then find one of Twitter's example pages where it does make a
difference.
</p>
<h4>Details</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Highlight borders in some color to illustrate the effect the CSS has</li>
    <li>Put CSS snippets that are responsible for changes in each page</li>
    <li>See if there's something online that would provide the CSS that affects each piece
    when you hover over it. Kinda like firebug, without needing firebug.</li>
    <li>Use jQuery that applies only the newest CSS and then toggles it
    on/off to more easily show the difference</li> 
</ul>
