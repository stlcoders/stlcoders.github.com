title: STL Coders -- Code something!
---
<h2>README.TXT</h2>
<p>This is the first piece of code written for Stlcoders.  The source can be found at
<a href="https://github.com/stlcoders/stlcoders.github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>  

<p>We're two developers who talked about code at work and decided
to start a coder group.  Here's some guidelines:</p>

<h3>More code, less talk</h3>
<p>Our meetings will focus on writing actual code.  Which sounds more fun to you?</p>
<ol>
    <li>Watch a presentation</li>
    <li>Take notes about history, setup, and syntax of a language or tool</li>
    <li>See a few examples</li>
    <li>Listen to Questions and Discussion</li>
    <li>Go home and throw your notes on a pile</li>
</ol>

Or,

<ol>
    <li>Sit with 2-3 fellow coders at an actual computer</li>
    <li>Write code</li>
    <li>Publish the code</li>
</ol>

(We're in the 2nd group, by the way)

<h3>Frequent Meetings</h3>
<p>We plan to meet *weekly* and very informally. Beer and coffee
are requisites, as well as laid-back atmosphere.  The less time
that's spent preparing for a meeting is more time that can be spent
writing actual code.</p>

<h3>Pair programming, beginner/n00b friendly</h3>
<p>Coders should take turns at the keyboard.  The purpose is to
learn and to write code.  You can't write code by watching.</p>

<h3>Share what we do.</h3>
<p>We intend to post snippets of what we've done to GitHub.
Perhaps the stuff we work on will spur more contributions and other
ideas.</p>

<p>Enough talk.  No, I won't keep you updated. If you're interested, e-mail me at
